# artificial-reality-app
This is an artificial reality app which uses target images to do specific tasks. In this app we used virtual buttons and virtual 2D screens. There are many virtual buttons with a corresponding virtual screen for each . The virtual buttons are virtually clicked and their behaviour  is determined by c sharp scrips.
