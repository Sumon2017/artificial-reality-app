# Why this project?

We were interested in augmented reality based apps. And this is our first AR app. We tried to implement multiple virtual buttons on multiple target images with virtual screen(video).

Children find it more interactive and fun to see virtual objects on e real paper and interact physically . It will help them learn new things interestingly with audio and augmented video.

# Features

This is an augmented reality app which uses target images to do specific tasks. In this app we used virtual buttons and virtual 2D screens. There are many virtual buttons with a corresponding virtual screen for each . The virtual buttons are virtually clicked and their behaviour  is determined by C#  scripts .
